# Boston House Price Regression

## Project Overview
This project is a **machine learning application** that predicts house prices in Boston based on various features of the houses and their neighborhoods. The system uses a **Linear Regression model** trained on the classic Boston Housing dataset.

The application also allows you to test **new input data** to get predicted house prices instantly.
